# Course Planner

## Abstract:
This is a course-planning platform that lets students schedule their classes and lets them know of possible conflicts in schedule. This project is prepared in HackPrinceton Fall 2018 with the motive to replace the existing course-planning  system of Rochester Institute of Technology that students have found to be very inefficient.
